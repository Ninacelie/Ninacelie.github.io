I knew I wanted to enter the tech field, not only for it's ever growing and evolving environment - but to inspire my daughter that your personal demographics such as gender, are not factors in success. Naturally, I am a very creative person and for years, I have played around with numerous career ideas. At the end of each of these attempts was always the hard realization that these jobs were not promising or likely to contribute to the future I had planned for my family. Once I realized there was an opportunity for women and mothers like me within the tech industry, I knew what my next (and hopefully final) career move needed to be. It feels good knowing I am playing a part in empowering other women around the world to do the same!

Where do I begin? Working on and completing my Rails project while simultaneously living throughout the horror of the COVID-19 pandemic - yikes! This past month has been a journey, to say the least. I found myself feeling confident and excited approaching Rails. We had just wrapped up Sinatra and it was the perfect transition into Rails. But there were a few learning curves along the way!

Rails' framework isn't nearly as effortless as Sinatra's, being you have to put in the extra work to ensure your models and controllers are working as they should. Starting out  - I began building out my associations, initial routes, and authentication system. I then implented an outside network option for login and signup via Omniauth with Facebook. This is one section I got hung up on the longest. The process of getting Omniauth not only implented but working felt endless. Most probably because it was my first time using it within a project. But fundamentally, it's very necessary, being users today love the idea of signing up for an application sans having to type in custom credentials. The more steps a user can skip prior to getting to the meat of the application, the better. And this is exactly the purpose of Omniauth, less mess. 

I'm half way there and with every month, module, and project under my belt; the confidence slowly grows. Looking forward to what's next! Although it felt a bit tedious in the beginning, the final conclusion was that Rails is ultimately more instinctive and adaptable to your needs.

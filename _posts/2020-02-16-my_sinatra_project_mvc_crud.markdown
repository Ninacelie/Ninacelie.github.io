In comparison to our first project, Sinatra felt a bit less intimidating. Although the intimidation was still there, it wasn't as overwhelming as it was the first go around. I've become familiar with creating working code and consequently, have had a small taste of achievement from the last project. This made the drive to finish my Sinatra project much more amplified! 

My less exciting moments consisted of silly syntax errors, using incorrect variable formatting, not creating a proper route, etc. These things seem like easy mistakes to catch, but more times than not, understanding your error can feel like you're at a complete dead end. I've learned getting up and taking a small break from my code is extremely beneficial in writing clear and concise code. 

Aside from screen breaks, having Flat Iron's very convenient and helpful educational videos goes a long way for me. I watched countless videos from numerous instructors on how to create a working Sinatra application. Although, because our applications are not two in the same, using the educational videos as a code along can only get you so far before you need to start creating and implementing your own knowledge / methods. This was challenging... but dare I say, fun? Yes, I found myself discouraged at times; but the confidence gained from completion takes the cake!
